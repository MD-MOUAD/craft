## Handle Layout, Typography, and Colors

> brijr/craft is a Design System developed using **one component file** paired with the best design tools for Next.js. Craft was put together by [Bridger Tower](https://bridger.to) at [9d8](https://9d8.dev) to build websites with NextJS, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and TypeScript faster ðŸš€

> Try it out using [brijr/components](https://github.com/brijr/components) ðŸ‘€

### Layout

Layout and Spacing is handled by the components provided in `craft.tsx`. You can use these components to build your layout. Here is an example of how to use the components:

```jsx
import { Main, Section, Container } from "@/components/craft";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Main>
      <Section>
        <Container>
          <h1>Heading</h1>
          <p>Content</p>
        </Container>
      </Section>
    </Main>
  );
}
```

This will handling the vertical and horizontal spacing, the max-width of the container, and the padding of the container and typography spacing. You can also use the `Article` component to handle the layout of an article as the max-width is a bit smaller for readability.

Check out the `craft.tsx` file to see how the components are styled and make changes accordingly.

### Typography

The Typography System is a modified version of [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography). You can find how it is styled in the `<Main />` and `<Article />` component of the `craft.tsx` file.

To manage fonts in your website/software I use [Next.js Font Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts). I prefer to use a variable font. Here is a [video about how this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8_98i_bMMA).

### Colors

To manage the colors of your website brijr/craft uses the [system by shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming). You can see this in the `app/globals.css` and you can make color changes accordingly. In order for this to work you use custom Tailwind styles such as `text-primary` or `bg-accent` etc. as defined in `globals.css`. Example below:

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --card: 0 0% 100%;
    --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --popover: 0 0% 100%;
    --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;
    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;
    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
    --ring: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --primary: 210 40% 98%;
    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;
    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;
    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
    --ring: 212.7 26.8% 83.9;
  }
}
```

By using this system it will also take care of dark mode coloring/styling. To add darkmode to your application add a [theme provider and theme toggle](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/next).

To find color schemes check out this tool provided by shadcn: [ui.shadcn.com/themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) or [ui.jln.dev](https://ui.jln.dev/).

## Setup and Getting Started

- [Create a Next.js application](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) and use Tailwind and Typescript

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
  ```

- Run this command to Install brijr/craft (this will also install shadcn/ui and all other dependencies)

  ```bash
  npx craft-ds@latest init
  ```

- Add craft components to build you layout

  ```jsx
  import {
    Layout,
    Main,
    Section,
    Container,
    Article,
  } from "@/components/craft.tsx";
  ```

## Handle Typography, Colors, and Layout

> brijr/craft is a Design System developed using **one component file** paired with the best design tools for Next.js. Craft was put together by [Bridger Tower](https://bridger.to) at [9d8](https://9d8.dev) to build websites with NextJS, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and TypeScript faster ðŸš€
>
> Try it out using [brijr/components](https://github.com/brijr/components) ðŸ‘€

### Typography 

The Typography System is a modified version of [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography). You can find how it is styled in the `<Main />` and `<Article />` component of the `craft.tsx` file.

To manage font usage I prefer to use [Next.js Font Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts). I prefer to use a variable font. Here is a [video about how this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8_98i_bMMA).


## Getting Started

- [Create a Next.js application](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) and use Tailwind and Typescript

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
  ```

- Run this command to Install brijr/craft (this will also install shadcn/ui and all other dependencies)

  ```bash
  npx brijr-craft@latest init
  ```

- Add craft components to build you layout

  ```jsx
  import { Layout, Main, Section, Container, Article } from '@/components/craft.tsx';
  ```

## Packages and Libraries 

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)

Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source. Built with Radix UI by [shadcn](https://shadcn.com). This handles the colors and the base components of brijr/craft.

### [React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app/) 

Simple React Component That Makes Titles More Readable. React Wrap Balancer reduces the width of the content wrapper as much as it could, before causing an extra line break. When reaching the minimum width, each line will approximately have the same width, and look more compact and balanced.

## Components

> There are currently five components
>
> - Layout
> - Main
> - Section
> - Container
> - Article

### Layout

The `Layout` component serves as the foundational element that wraps around your application's structure. It sets up the basic layout and applies global styles.

**Props:**

- `children: React.ReactNode` - The content to be displayed within the layout.
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes to customize the appearance.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Layout className="custom-class">
  {/* content here */}
</Layout>
```

### Main

The `Main` component is designed to be used as the primary content container within your application.

**Props:**

- `children: React.ReactNode` - The main content of your application.
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes for styling.
- `id?: string` - An optional ID for targeting or referencing the element.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Main className="custom-class" id="main-content">
  {/* main content here */}
</Main>
```

### Section

The `Section` component is intended for wrapping different sections of your application, providing a way to organize your content semantically.

**Props:**

- `children: React.ReactNode` - The content within this section.
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes for styling.
- `id?: string` - An optional ID for the section.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Section className="custom-section" id="unique-section">
  {/* section content here */}
</Section>
```

### Container

The `Container` component acts as a wrapper for your content, constraining its width and centering it within the layout.

**Props:**

- `children: React.ReactNode` - The content to be contained.
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes for styling.
- `id?: string` - An optional ID for the container.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Container className="custom-container" id="container-id">
  {/* contained content here */}
</Container>
```

### Article

The `Article` component is specifically designed for wrapping article or blog post content, ensuring it's properly styled and accessible.

**Props:**

- `children: React.ReactNode` - The article content.
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes for styling.
- `id?: string` - An optional ID for the article.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Article className="custom-article" id="article-id">
  {/* article content here */}
</Article>
```

## Installation

To use these components in your project, install the package via npm:

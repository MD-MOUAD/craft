## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Article component with some content:

```tsx
import { Article } from "@/components/craft";

export default function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <Article>
      <h1>The Future of Web Development</h1>
      <p>As we look ahead to the coming years, web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace...</p>
      <h2>Emerging Technologies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>WebAssembly</li>
        <li>Progressive Web Apps</li>
        <li>AI-driven Development</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        "The only constant in web development is change." - Anonymous
      </blockquote>
      <p>As developers, we must stay adaptable and continue learning to keep up with these exciting changes.</p>
    </Article>
  );
}
```

This setup provides a well-structured and styled article that will look great on any device and in any color scheme.

## Best Practices

1. Use semantic HTML tags within the Article component for better structure and accessibility.
2. Take advantage of the built-in typography styles for consistent formatting.
3. Use the `className` prop for minor style adjustments, but avoid overriding core styles unless necessary.
4. Consider using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop when rendering content from a CMS or other external source, but be cautious of potential security risks.

The Article component in Craft Design System makes it easy to create beautifully formatted, responsive, and accessible content with minimal effort.
